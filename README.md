# END TO END Q&A CHATBOT WITH OLLAMA

## About The Chatbot: This is completely accessible for free,because Ollama provides OpenSource models which you can access for free of cost, i personally tried with models like DeepSeek-R1,mistral,Llama3.2 and there are many more models available you can checkout those,but before you run this code,make sure you download the Ollama models in your system(Example:ollama run mistral)

## To run code:streamlit run your_file_name.py
